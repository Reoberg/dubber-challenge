Dubber Junior Developer Coding Challenge

## Introduction
First of all, I decided to make a full-stack app to demonstrate the Lottery Challenge. Which uses React at Frontend and Python FastAPI at Backend.
I could directly develop it with using with React and make the number generator directly with javascript in React but I wanted to illustrate that how I build full-stack structure and what kind of additions I could do in future. Recently, I am also trying to get AWS Cloud Practioner Certificate so I also wanted to give additional info that how I would move this full-stack app to AWS or even maybe Kubernetes in AWS. So let's start.

## STEP 1: INITIALIZATION 
Started with installing necessary packages for backend and created backend folder. 
Frontend:
- Created a Python VENV : python3 -m venv venv
- Activated Venv to install necessary packages with pip: source venv/bin/activate
- Installed necessary packages (fastapi, uvicorn) on requirements.txt that I created: pip install -r requirements.txt

Backend:
- On terminal I created Vite Application with React Framework for Frontend: npm create vite@latest frontend --template react
- I deleted the unnecessary files and example codes in App.jsx and leaved ready to write my code in src/App.jsx
- Installed tailwindcss to give a basic good look. Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

## STEP 2: BACKEND
